# Instructions  

Your goal in this project will be to come up with a simple word game you can make.

You could think of a game like Hangman or Wordle as inspiration.

To help you, I have provided you with a phrase dictionary and a word dictionary.

## Requirements

You will need to:

1. Create custom entries for your game to enforce game rules / help with game play. See my word entry as an example.
2. Create animations to reveal guesses / answers.
3. Find a way to store information about past play to store "streaks" or high scores.
4. Give your game a professional, polished and unique look and feel. The entries and buttons should not look like browser defaults!
